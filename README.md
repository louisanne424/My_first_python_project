# Bucketlist App

This is a simple Python project that allows users to create and manage a bucketlist.

## Features
- Add activities
- View bucketlist
- Update bucketlist
- Remove items
- Exit app

## Notes
This is the first version of the app. More changes and updates will be added later on.  
I know first projects may seem a bit rough, but I hope I tried my best ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
